Planning: Learn C# and Unity. Then I would need a collision detection function, that either made the fishy bigger or told the user the game was over. I also needed a function for controlling the movement of the player.

MVP: The user will control a player who is a fishy. Other fish will be moving left. Then I will make a function to detect collisions. If the fishy collides with a smaller fish, the fishy grows and the user gains 1 point. If the fishy collides with a larger fish the game is over. The setting is under water.

Game Play: There is no Winning in Fishy. Only losing or staying alive. Using Unity, the user either swims into a bigger fish and loses, or swims into a smaller fish and grows. The user controls the fish using the arrow keys.

Bugs/Obstacles: Unity caused me some problems multiple times.

features: Environment and physics.


Tech: I want to use C# and Unity
